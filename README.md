Aim: The objective of this workflow is to serve as a live, fully functional project developed for a faith-based organization, specifically my church. It is designed to streamline and automate the event registration process. Once a participant registers for an event through a structured tally form, the workflow ensures that a confirmation email is automatically sent to the registrant. At the same time, the submitted data is seamlessly captured and stored in an integrated Google Sheet, creating a reliable system for both communication and record-keeping.
