##### <h1 align="center"> Aim  </h1>
The objective of this workflow is to serve as a live, fully functional project developed for a faith-based organization, specifically my church. It is designed to streamline and automate the event registration process. Once a participant registers for an event through a structured tally form, the workflow ensures that a confirmation email is automatically sent to the registrant. At the same time, the submitted data is seamlessly captured and stored in an integrated Google Sheet, creating a reliable system for both communication and record-keeping.

##### <h1 align="center"> Tools  </h1>
* Tally Forms – used as the entry point where participants fill out event registration details.  

* Google Sheets – serves as the central database that stores and organizes all submitted registration records.   

* n8n – functions as the automation engine, linking the form and database to automatically send confirmation emails and keep the workflow running smoothly.
